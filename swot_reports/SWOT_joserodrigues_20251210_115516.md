Okay, let's tackle this SWOT analysis based on the provided documents. Wait, the user mentioned "documentos fornecidos acima," but I don't see any documents here. Hmm, maybe they forgot to include them. But since I'm supposed to base the analysis EXCLUSIVAMENTE on the provided documents, and there are none, I need to figure out how to handle this.

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in not attaching the documents. But as an AI, I can't ask for clarification. The instructions say to use the documents provided, so if there are none, I can't proceed. But maybe in the context of the problem, the documents are supposed to be part of the previous messages. Let me check again.

Looking back at the user's message, they provided a context section but it's empty. The "CONTEXTO DOS DOCUMENTOS" is blank. So there's no actual data to analyze. That's a problem. How do I respond?

The user is asking for a SWOT analysis based on the documents, but there are none. So the correct response would be to point out that the documents are missing. But the instructions say to base it EXCLUSIVELY on the provided documents. Since there are none, I can't generate the analysis. However, maybe the user expects me to state that the documents are missing.

Wait, the user might have intended to include documents but forgot. In that case, the proper response is to inform them that the documents are missing. But the task says "Baseado EXCLUSIVAMENTE nos documentos fornecidos acima," so if there's nothing provided, the answer should state that.

But looking at the example response they provided in the instructions, they have a detailed SWOT with citations. But since there's no data, I can't make up citations. So the correct answer here is to note that the documents are missing. However, the user might have made a mistake, so I should respond that the documents weren't included.

Wait, but the user's instruction says "CONTEXTO DOS DOCUMENTOS:" followed by nothing. So the context is empty. Therefore, the analysis can't be done. But the user might expect me to proceed as if there were documents, but that's not possible. So the right move is to state that the documents are missing.

But the problem is, the user might have a typo or error. However, as per the instructions, I must use only the provided documents. Since none are provided, I can't generate the SWOT. So the answer should be to point out the missing documents.

Wait, but the user is asking for a response in a specific format. If I say the documents are missing, that's the only correct thing. Let me check if maybe the documents are in the "CONTEXTO DOS DOCUMENTOS" section but got cut off. But in the user's message, it's empty. So I have to go with that.

Therefore, the correct response is to state that the documents are missing, so the analysis can't be performed. But the user might want me to proceed with a template or something. However, the instructions say to use the provided documents, so I can't make up data.

So the answer should be something like: "Os documentos necessários para a análise não foram fornecidos. Por favor, inclua os documentos para que a análise SWOT possa ser realizada."

But the user might have intended to include them, so maybe in the actual scenario, the documents are there, but in this case, they're not. Since I'm supposed to follow the instructions strictly, I have to state that the documents are missing.

Wait, but the user provided the task and instructions, but the context is empty. So the answer must be that there are no documents. Let me check the example response they provided. The example has a detailed SWOT, but that's just an example. The actual response needs to be based on the documents, which are missing.

Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the documents are missing. But since the user is asking for the analysis, maybe I should write that in the required format. Let me structure it as per the instructions, but with the note that documents are missing.

Wait, the instructions say "Baseado EXCLUSIVAMENTE nos documentos fornecidos acima," so if there's nothing, the analysis can't be done. So in the SWOT sections, I should leave them empty or state the reason.

But the user might expect me to fill it out, but I can't. So the proper way is to state that the documents are missing. Let me check if the user's message had any hidden documents. The user wrote:

"CONTEXTO DOS DOCUMENTOS:

TAREFA:
..."

So the context is empty. So the answer should be that the context is missing.

Therefore, in the SWOT analysis, all sections would be empty, but the user might want a note. However, the format requires listing each section. So perhaps in each section, state that the documents are missing.

But the instructions say to cite specific phrases from the comments or captions, which don't exist here. So the correct response is to point out the missing documents.

I think the best approach is to write in the response that the documents were not provided, so the analysis cannot be completed. But since the user might have made a mistake, I should state that clearly.

So, in the format they specified, under each section, I'll state that the documents are missing. But the user might not want that. Wait, the user is probably testing if I'll notice the missing documents. So the correct answer is to state that the documents are missing.

Alright, I'll proceed to write that in the response.
